# Application Insights SDK JavaScript API

The JavaScript SDK is loaded into your web page when you set up [web page tracking](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-javascript/) in [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/).
You add a short snippet of code to the page, which pulls in the rest of the SDK.

* [Overview of the API and examples](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/)
* Non-minified built code: [ai.js](https://az416426.vo.msecnd.net/scripts/a/ai.js)

## class AppInsights

The shop front for the SDK, that sends telemetry to Application Insights.

In a web page where you have [set up web page tracking](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-javascript/), you can use the instance `appInsights`. For example:
    
    appInsights.trackPageView("page1");


### trackPageView

    trackPageView(name?: string, url?: string, properties?:{[string]:string}, measurements?: {[string]:number}, duration?: number)

Logs that a page or similar container was displayed to the user. 

Parameter | Description
---|---
`name` | The name used to identify the page in the portal. Defaults to the document title.
`url` |  A relative or absolute URL that identifies the page or similar item. Defaults to the window location.
`properties` | Map of string to string: Additional data used to [filter pages](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/#properties) in the portal. Defaults to empty.
`measurements` | Map of string to number: Metrics associated with this page, displayed in Metrics Explorer on the portal. Defaults to empty.
`duration` | The number of milliseconds it took to load this page, displayed in Metrics Explorer on the portal. Defaults to empty. If empty, end of page view duration is recorded when browser page load event is called.

The standard snippet that you get from the portal includes a call to trackPageView. If you insert your own calls, consider
removing this default. An example where you might write your own calls is where your app is a single HTML page that has multiple
tabs, and you want to log a page view when each tab opens.

### startTrackPage

    startTrackPage(name?: string)
    
Starts the timer for tracking a page view. Use this instead of ```trackPageView``` if you want to control when the page view timer starts and stops, but don't want to calculate the duration yourself. This method doesn't send any telemetry. Call ```stopTrackPage``` to log the end of the page view and send the event.

Parameter | Description
---|---
`name` | The name used to identify the page in the portal. Defaults to the document title.

### stopTrackPage

    stopTrackPage(name?: string, url?: string, properties?: { [name: string]: string; }, measurements?: { [name: string]: number; });

Stops the timer that was started by calling ```startTrackPage``` and sends the page view telemetry with the specified properties and measurements. The duration of the page view will be the time between calling ```startTrackPage``` and ```stopTrackPage```.

Parameter | Description
---|---
`name` | The name used to identify the page in the portal. Defaults to the document title.
`url` |  A relative or absolute URL that identifies the page or similar item. Defaults to the window location.
`properties` | Map of string to string: Additional data used to [filter pages](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/#properties) in the portal. Defaults to empty.
`measurements` | Map of string to number: Metrics associated with this page, displayed in Metrics Explorer on the portal. Defaults to empty.

### trackEvent

    trackEvent(name: string, properties?: {[string]:string}, measurements?: {[string]:number})

Log a user action or other occurrence.

Parameter | Description
---|---
 `name` | Identifies the event. Events with the same name are counted and can be charted in [Metric Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-metrics-explorer/).
`properties` | Map of string to string: Additional data used to [filter events](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/#properties) in the portal. Defaults to empty.
`measurements` | Map of string to number: Metrics associated with this page, displayed in Metrics Explorer on the portal. Defaults to empty.

In the portal, you can select events by name, and [display charts that count them or display associated measurements](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-metrics-explorer/).

You can also search and [display individual events](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-diagnostic-search/).


### trackMetric

    trackMetric(name: string, average: number, sampleCount?: number, min?: number, max?: number, properties?: {[string]:string})

Log a positive numeric value that is not associated with a specific event. Typically used to send regular reports of performance indicators. 

Parameter | Description
---|---
`name` | A string that identifies the metric. In the portal, you can select metrics for display by name.
`average` | Either a single measurement, or the average of several measurements. Should be >=0 to be correctly displayed.
`sampleCount` | Count of measurements represented by the average. Defaults to 1. Should be >=1.
`min` | The smallest measurement in the sample. Defaults to the average. Should be >= 0.
`max` | The largest measurement in the sample. Defaults to the average. Should be >= 0.
`properties` | Map of string to string: Additional data used to [filter events](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/#properties) in the portal.

In the portal, you can select metrics by name to [chart their values over time](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-metrics-explorer/). You can't search or view individual trackMetric calls.

To send a single measurement, use just the first two parameters. If you take measurements very frequently, you can reduce the telemetry bandwidth by aggregating multiple measurements and sending the resulting average at intervals.


### trackException

    trackException(exception: Error, handledAt?: string, properties?: {[string]:string}, measurements?: {[string]:number}, severityLevel?: AI.SeverityLevel)

Log an exception you have caught. (Exceptions caught by the browser are also logged.)

Parameter | Description
---|---
`exception` | An Error from a catch clause.  
`handledAt` | Defaults to "unhandled".
`properties` | Map of string to string: Additional data used to [filter exceptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/#properties) in the portal. Defaults to empty.
`measurements` | Map of string to number: Metrics associated with this page, displayed in Metrics Explorer on the portal. Defaults to empty.
`severityLevel` | Supported values: [SeverityLevel.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/master/JavaScript/JavaScriptSDK.Interfaces/Contracts/Generated/SeverityLevel.ts)

In the portal, you can [search on exception type and view](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-diagnostic-search/) the type, message, and stack trace of individual instances. 

By default, uncaught browser exceptions are caught by the SDK and reported to the portal. To disable this behavior, insert the following line in the initialization snippet that you got from the portal. You can't set this anywhere else:

    })({
    instrumentationKey: "your instrumentation key",

    disableExceptionTracking: true
    });


### trackTrace

    trackTrace(message: string, properties?: {[string]:string}, severityLevel?: AI.SeverityLevel)

Log a diagnostic event such as entering or leaving a method.

 Parameter | Description
---|---
`message` | Diagnostic data. Can be much longer than a name.
`properties` | Map of string to string: Additional data used to [filter exceptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/#properties) in the portal. Defaults to empty.
`severityLevel` | Supported values: [SeverityLevel.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/master/JavaScript/JavaScriptSDK.Interfaces/Contracts/Generated/SeverityLevel.ts)


In the portal, you can search on message content and [display individual trackTrace events](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-diagnostic-search/).
(Unlike `trackEvent`, you can't filter on the message content in the portal.)


### trackDependency

    trackDependency(id: string, method: string, absoluteUrl: string, pathName: string, totalTime: number, success: boolean, resultCode: number) {
    
Log a dependency call (for instance: ajax)

 Parameter | Description
---|---

`method` | Represents request verb (GET, POST, etc.)
`absoluteUrl` | Absolute url used to make the dependency request
`pathName` | Path part of the absolute url
`totalTime` | Total request time
`success` | Indicates if the request was successful
`resultCode` | Response code returned by the dependency request


### flush

    flush()

Immediately send all queued telemetry. Synchronous.

You don't usually have to use this, as it happens automatically on window closing.

<a name="setAuthenticatedUserContext"></a>
### setAuthenticatedUserContext

    setAuthenticatedUserContext(authenticatedUserId: string, accountId?: string)

Set the authenticated user id and the account id in this session. Use this when you have identified a specific signed-in user. Parameters must not contain spaces or ,;=|

 Parameter | Description
---|---
`authenticatedUserId` | An id that uniquely identifies a user of your app. No spaces, comma, semicolon, equals or vertical bar.
`accountId` | An optional account id, if your app groups users into accounts. No spaces, comma, semicolon, equals or vertical bar.
    
In the portal, this will add to the count of authenticated users. Authenticated users provide a more reliable count of the number of real users than the count of anonymous users.

The authenticated user id will be available as part of the context of the telemetry sent to the portal, so that you can filter and search on it. It will also be saved as a cookie and sent to the server, where the server SDK (if installed) will attach it to server telemetry.

### clearAuthenticatedUserContext

    clearAuthenticatedUserContext ()

Clears the authenticated user id and the account id from the user context, and clears the associated cookie.


### config

    config: IConfig

Values that control how the telemetry data is sent.

    interface IConfig {

        // performance is calculated using the navigation timing API.
        overridePageViewDuration: boolean;
        
        // Default 500 - controls how many ajax calls will be monitored per page view.
        // Set to -1 to monitor all ajax calls on the page.
        maxAjaxCallsPerView: number;

        // Is retry handler disabled. Default false.
        // If enabled, retry on 206 (partial success), 408 (timeout), 429 (too many requests), 500 (internal server error) and 503 (service unavailable).
        isRetryDisabled: boolean;

        // The url from where the JS SDK will be downloaded. 
        // Default 'https://az416426.vo.msecnd.net/scripts/a/ai.0.js'
        url: string;

        // If true, the SDK will not store or read any data from local and session storage.
        // Default: false
        isStorageUseDisabled: boolean;
	
        // Default true. If false, the SDK will add two headers ('x-ms-request-root-id' and 'x-ms-request-id) 
        // to all dependency requests (within the same domain) to correlate them with corresponding requests on the server side. 
        disableCorrelationHeaders: boolean;
        
        // If true, the SDK will send all telemetry using [Beacon API](https://www.w3.org/TR/beacon/)

        isBrowserLinkTrackingEnabled: boolean;
    }

Set these values in [the snippet](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-javascript/) that you insert in your web pages.
Look for this line, and add more items:

    })({
      instrumentationKey: "000...000"
    });

You can also read or write them dynamically:

    appInsights.config.disableTelemetry = true;
